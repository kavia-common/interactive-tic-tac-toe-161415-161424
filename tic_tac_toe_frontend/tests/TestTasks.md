# Tic Tac Toe Frontend — Detailed Test Task Descriptions

This document outlines 20 comprehensive testable scenarios for the Tic Tac Toe React application covering gameplay features, UI/UX behaviors, controls, accessibility, and edge cases.

1) Game Board Rendering and Initial State
- Goal: Verify that on initial load the game board renders a 3x3 grid with all cells empty and interactive.
- Preconditions: Fresh app load; no persisted game state in storage.
- Steps:
  1. Load the app at root route.
  2. Assert presence of a visible title/header and the 3x3 board.
  3. Verify each of the 9 cells is empty, focusable/clickable, and has appropriate aria-label (e.g., “Cell row X col Y”).
  4. Verify current player indicator shows “Player X to move” (or equivalent).
  5. Verify control buttons (Reset/New Game) are visible, enabled, and have clear labels.
- Expected: All elements render; cells have no marks; status shows Player X; no winner/draw state present.

2) Turn Alternation and Mark Placement
- Goal: Validate alternating turns and correct symbol placement on click.
- Steps:
  1. Click a cell (top-left).
  2. Verify it now shows “X” and status updates to “Player O to move.”
  3. Click a different cell (top-center).
  4. Verify it now shows “O” and status updates to “Player X to move.”
  5. Ensure previously clicked cells are not overwritten.
- Expected: Marks alternate X/O correctly; turn indicator updates; previous moves persist.

3) Prevent Overwriting Occupied Cells
- Goal: Ensure a user cannot place a mark on an already-occupied cell and receives proper feedback.
- Steps:
  1. Place X at (0,0).
  2. Attempt to place O at (0,0) again.
  3. Observe that the cell content remains X.
  4. Verify a non-intrusive UI cue occurs (e.g., subtle shake, aria-live polite message).
- Expected: No overwrite; user receives visual or ARIA feedback; turn remains O.

4) Win Detection — Horizontal
- Goal: Confirm winner detection logic for horizontal lines and correct end-of-game behavior.
- Steps:
  1. X: (0,0); O: (1,0); X: (0,1); O: (1,1); X: (0,2).
  2. Verify winner status displays “X wins.”
  3. Validate that remaining empty cells are no longer interactive.
  4. Check winner highlight styling on winning cells.
- Expected: Winner detected immediately upon winning move; board locks; winning cells highlighted.

5) Win Detection — Vertical
- Goal: Confirm winner detection logic for vertical lines.
- Steps:
  1. X: (0,0); O: (0,1); X: (1,0); O: (0,2); X: (2,0).
  2. Verify “X wins” and vertical column highlight.
- Expected: Correct winner; correct highlight; board locked post-win.

6) Win Detection — Diagonal
- Goal: Confirm winner detection for both diagonals.
- Steps:
  1. X: (0,0); O: (0,1); X: (1,1); O: (1,0); X: (2,2).
  2. Verify “X wins” and diagonal highlight from top-left to bottom-right.
- Expected: Diagonal win detected; highlight matches diagonal; board locked.

7) Draw Detection and Post-Draw State
- Goal: Confirm draw detection when the board is full without a winner.
- Steps:
  1. Play out a sequence resulting in full board, no win (e.g., X:00 O:01 X:02 O:11 X:10 O:20 X:21 O:22 X:12).
  2. Verify status shows “Draw” and no cells remain interactive.
  3. Verify appropriate draw highlight/visual state (e.g., subtle board overlay).
- Expected: Correct draw state and locked board.

8) Reset/New Game Functionality
- Goal: Ensure pressing Reset/New Game clears the board and state entirely.
- Steps:
  1. Make several moves or reach a win.
  2. Click Reset/New Game.
  3. Verify all cells empty, turn resets to Player X, winner/draw indicators cleared, highlights removed.
- Expected: Clean reset; no residual state; controls enabled.

9) Move History Recording and Navigation
- Goal: Validate move history list records each move and supports jump-to-state.
- Steps:
  1. Make 4 moves (X/O/X/O).
  2. Verify move list shows 4 entries with precise move indices and coordinates.
  3. Click “Go to move 2” (or equivalent).
  4. Board reverts to that state; turn indicator updated accordingly.
  5. Clicking “Go to latest” replays to current state.
- Expected: Accurate history recording; deterministic time-travel; UI clearly indicates current state.

10) Highlight Current Move in History
- Goal: Ensure the currently selected move in move history is visually highlighted and accessible.
- Steps:
  1. Make several moves.
  2. Navigate to a prior move in history.
  3. Verify selected move has highlight styling and correct aria-selected attribute for accessibility.
- Expected: Clear indication of current historical state selection.

11) Responsive Board Layout and Sidebar Behavior
- Goal: Validate responsive layout across breakpoints and correct arrangement of board and history.
- Steps:
  1. Load at desktop width (≥1024px) — board centered, history sidebar visible on side.
  2. Resize to tablet (768–1024px) — ensure spacing and legibility remain; sidebar fits.
  3. Resize to mobile (<768px) — sidebar moves below board or collapses behind a toggle.
  4. Interact with the board at each size to ensure no overflow or tap issues.
- Expected: Seamless responsive adjustments; no layout shifts interfering with gameplay.

12) Control Buttons: Disable Rules and States
- Goal: Ensure all control buttons reflect correct enabled/disabled states throughout game progression.
- Steps:
  1. At initial state, verify Reset is enabled; Undo/Redo (if present) reflect availability.
  2. During play, check Undo enabled after at least one move; Redo enabled after undo.
  3. After win/draw, Undo/Redo and Reset behave as designed; New Game always available.
- Expected: Controls correctly enabled/disabled; aria-disabled set; tooltips or helper text optional.

13) Accessibility: Keyboard Navigation and ARIA Live Regions
- Goal: Confirm full keyboard accessibility and appropriate announcements of changes.
- Steps:
  1. Navigate to cells using Tab/Arrow keys.
  2. Press Enter/Space to place marks.
  3. Verify that turn changes, wins, draws are announced via aria-live (polite or assertive).
  4. Confirm focus management after a move and after Reset.
- Expected: Fully operable via keyboard; live announcements present and not duplicated.

14) Theming/Contrast and Dark Mode Responsiveness
- Goal: Validate light/dark themes, contrast, and color usage on all states.
- Steps:
  1. Toggle theme control (if present).
  2. Verify text, board lines, marks, and highlights meet contrast requirements in both themes.
  3. Inspect focus rings and hover states in dark mode.
  4. Ensure winner/draw highlight styling remains accessible.
- Expected: Proper theme switch; accessible contrast; consistent visual cues.

15) Error Handling and Invalid Interactions
- Goal: Ensure the UI gracefully handles invalid interactions without crashing.
- Steps:
  1. Rapidly click the same cell multiple times.
  2. Try clicking after a win or draw.
  3. Attempt to navigate to an invalid history index (if possible via UI).
  4. Observe any errors in console or user-facing toasts.
- Expected: No crashes; invalid actions ignored with gentle feedback; no console errors.

16) Performance and Responsiveness Under Rapid Interactions
- Goal: Validate UI responsiveness and state integrity under stress.
- Steps:
  1. Simulate (programmatically or via automation) rapid alternating clicks on valid empty cells.
  2. Confirm no dropped updates, duplicated moves, or wrong turn orders.
  3. Ensure FPS and responsiveness remain acceptable on low-powered devices (if test infra supports).
- Expected: Stable state transitions; no visual jitter; no race conditions.

17) Winner Highlight and Non-Winning Cell De-emphasis
- Goal: Verify that winner highlight distinctly emphasizes winning line and de-emphasizes other cells.
- Steps:
  1. Achieve a win condition.
  2. Verify winning cells’ highlight style (e.g., bold border, glow).
  3. Verify non-winning cells are visually de-emphasized but still readable (unless hidden by design).
- Expected: Clear visual focus on winning line; consistent across themes.

18) Persisted State (If Implemented)
- Goal: If the app persists state (e.g., localStorage), verify restore and clear flows.
- Steps:
  1. Make several moves; reload page.
  2. Verify board and history are restored.
  3. Click Reset; reload again.
  4. Verify state is cleared and initial board shown.
- Expected: Accurate persistence/restore; Reset clears persisted state.

19) Announcements and Status Bar Accuracy
- Goal: Ensure the main status/announcement area shows correct text across all states.
- Steps:
  1. Before first move: “Player X to move.”
  2. During play: updates to “Player O to move,” etc.
  3. On win: “X wins.” On draw: “Draw.”
  4. After history jump: status matches the selected historical state.
- Expected: Accurate and timely status copy; no stale messages.

20) Visual Regression of Core UI Elements
- Goal: Maintain consistent visual layout for board, history, and controls via snapshots or image diffs.
- Steps:
  1. Capture baseline snapshots for initial state, midgame, win, draw, and dark mode.
  2. Compare against future builds to detect unintended visual changes.
- Expected: Stable visuals; flagged diffs require review; intentional changes update baselines.

Notes:
- Where features are “if implemented,” ensure tests are skipped/pending if feature absent.
- For coordinates, (row, col) indexing should align with implementation (0-based assumed here).
- Accessibility should align with WCAG AA where feasible (aria-live usage, focus rings, contrast).
